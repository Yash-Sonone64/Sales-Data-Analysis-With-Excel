# Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze a large dataset containing over 1 million sales records to uncover
valuable insights for enhancing product performance,optimizing sales strategies, and improving overall sales efficiency. 
The dataset includes fields such as ProductID, SalesRepID, Country, Town, Date, Units, RevenueDiscount, SubCategory Key, Product Color, ProductName, Product RetailPrice, and more.

# Analytical Questions
1.	Date Analysis: How many unique dates are present in the dataset? Provide a summary of sales on each date.
2.	Sales Distribution: What is the distribution of Units sold across different SalesRepIDs? Are there any sales representatives significantly outperforming others?
3.	Product Performance: Which product (ProductName) has the highest RevenueDiscount percentage? What does this indicate about pricing strategies?
4.	Country Sales Comparison: Compare total sales (Units * ProductRetailPrice) across different countries. Which country has the highest total sales, and what factors might contribute to this?
5.	Subcategory Analysis: What are the total sales and average ProductRetailPrice for each Sub Category Key? Identify any subcategories that have exceptionally high or low performance.
# Pivot Table Analysis Questions
1.	Total Units Sold by Sales Representative: Create a pivot table to summarize total units sold by each SalesRepID. What insights can you draw from this data?
2.	Revenue by Country and Town: Use a pivot table to analyze revenue generated by each country and town. Which town has the highest revenue in Germany?
3.	Average Price by Color: Create a pivot table to find the average Product RetailPrice for each Product Color. Which color category has the highest average retail price?
4.	Discount Analysis: How does the total Revenue Discount vary across different Sub Category Keys? Create a pivot table to illustrate this.
5.	Sales Performance Over Time: Build a pivot table that shows total units sold and revenue generated by month. What months see the highest sales?
6.	Product Performance: Create a pivot table to compare total sales (Units sold) and average RevenueDiscount for each ProductName. Which products have the best sales performance?
# Hypothesis Testing Questions
1.	Hypothesis on Discounts: Test the hypothesis that a higher RevenueDiscount leads to increased Units sold. What statistical methods will you use to test this, and what data will you analyze?
